Say you have written a new function called my_function

my_function <- function(){
  print("New function!")
}
You need to document it in the same R file. So your complete R file would look something like this

#' my_function
#' 
#' A function to print the words "New function!"
#'
#' @return A character vector
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' my_function()

my_function <- function(){
  print("New function!")
}
Now save this file in your R/ directory in the package

Run devtools::document() and that will update your man/ directory.

You have now added a new function to your package

In my opinion, the book R Packages is the best guide. You can read it for free at that link
